# Medi-Share
The pharmaceutical industry in India suffers a significant loss every year due to the destruction of expired drugs, particularly affecting small and medium drug manufacturers. At the same time, there are many households where medicines remain unused and expire. To address these issues, Medi-Share allows individuals to donate their unused, unexpired medications to a community pharmacy or medicine bank that will distribute them to people in need, free of charge.

The application has several potential features, including the ability to appoint and manage volunteers by NGO admins who can help collect unused medicines, track and manage the collected medicines, and connect users with relevant NGOs and charitable trusts. Additionally, doctors can join the local community to offer their assistance and expertise to the NGO. Users can message with other users or in global community chat, view nearby hospital details, view disease predictions based on symptoms, etc.

To prevent the misuse of donated medicines, there is a cap on the quantity that is supplied to each consumer. A proper dashboard is also in place to monitor the usage of the collected medicines and to provide an expiry date alert feature.

Through this initiative, people can now dispose of unused medicines in a safe and responsible manner, while also helping those who cannot afford essential medicines due to financial constraints. Overall, this project has the potential to make a significant impact by reducing the destruction of expired medicines, promoting community involvement, and providing essential medicines to those in need, free of cost.
